# Final-Project
IronhackÂ´s final project

One of the most remarkable details of this project is that it updates week to week thanks to the web-sraping code. When the information about four European football leagues is collected, the dataframes are constructed with the precise structure to run the next steps. Useful and interesting information is presented as plots, but then the most interesting part comes in hand.

## Predictions: Poisson vs Bet365

The goal of the project was to determine with ML models wich way was the best to accuretely predict football matches, one model is fed with the Poisson distribution, the other one takes into account the odds given by the famous betting site. The results are shown in the code named pro_final.ipynb, and it's also synthesized and presented on a PowerPoint file.
